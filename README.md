# AutoCAD 2000/2002/20xx Launcher
A launcher for AutoCAD 2000/2002 and newer that allows open multiple drawings in a single window on Windows7/10 with UAC enabled or if MS Office not installed


AutoCAD 2000/2002 requires administrative privileges, therefor with UAC enabled it opens separate window each time a new .dwg file is opened from explorer even if "Single-drawing compatibility mode" is disabled (SDI = 0).

This launcher fixes this issue.

How to use:
copy AcLauncher2000.exe into same directory where acad.exe is
launch .dwg files via right click -> "Open With"
(You can make it permanently associated with the launcher by enabling "Always use this app to open .dwg files" in the dialog)
